[cs50](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x) is a really fun + interesting compsci course from harvard

i started doing it while learning js, and while most of the psets require you to write C, i had a lot of 'ohhhhh, that explains that thing' moments that make certain aspects of js more understandable (like pointers + how js objects behave like they are passed by reference).

highly recommended for beginner programmers who feel that higher-level languages like js involve satanic magic.
